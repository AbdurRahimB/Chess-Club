                <p>Chess has been played for centuries across the world by children and grownups. It has many benefits
                    for the player. It will teach one to be patience, thinking strategically, team working, creativity
                    and better in planning. Researches show many interesting fact and figures about chess player’s
                    mental capability and their psychological benefits.</p>

                    <h3>Patience and Perseverance </h3>
                    <p>
                        Chess is not a game that can be won quickly or easily.
                        It requires patience and perseverance to see a game through to the end,
                        and even more so to become a skilled player.
                        This type of persistence can be beneficial in all areas of life,
                        teaching players to stick with difficult tasks and see them through to the end.

                    <h3>Cognitive Function </h3>
                    <p>
                        Playing chess requires a great deal of critical thinking, strategic planning, and
                        problem-solving
                        skills. As a result, regular practice can improve your cognitive function, helping you to become
                        more mentally sharp and alert. In fact, studies have shown that chess players tend to have
                        better
                        memory, attention span, and overall brain function than those who do not play.

                    <h3>Chess improves memory </h3>
                    <p>
                        It might not be surprising to learn that expert chess players have strong memory skills. After
                        all,
                        the game involves memorizing numerous combinations of moves and their potential outcomes.
                        It’s also interesting to note that experienced chess players show higher performance related to
                        a
                        particular kind of recollection: auditory memory. This is the ability to remember what you’ve
                        learned through hearing.
                        In one experiment, researchersTrusted Source compared the recall ability of expert chess players
                        to
                        that of people with no chess-playing experience. They found that the chess players were
                        significantly better at recalling lists of words they’d heard than people who had never played
                        chess.
                        Skilled chess players also have a better than average ability to remember and quickly recognize
                        visual patterns, which researchersTrusted Source think comes from memorizing complex chess
                        positions.

                    <p>
                        In a 2019 research review, scientists found that the complex mental flexibility chess demands
                        could help protect older people from dementia.
                        Researchers found evidence that the game, which challenges memory, calculation, visual-spatial
                        skills, and critical thinking abilities, may help reduce cognitive decline and postpone the
                        effects of dementia as you age.

                        In a 2016 study involving 100 school-age children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,
                        researchers included regular chess playing in a multi-faceted treatment approach.
                        Students who participated in this treatment method experienced a 41 percent decrease in both
                        inattentiveness and over-activity following the course of treatment.

                    <p>
                        Whether you play chess in person or online, you often learn the most from your opponents. You’re
                        also able to improve a number of your social skills in the process, including communication,
                        sportsmanship, and collaboration. Playing chess can also help build relationships and foster a
                        sense of community among players.

                    <h3>Planning skills </h3>
                    <p>Chess games are known for long periods of silent contemplation, during which players consider
                        each move. Players spend time anticipating their opponents’ responses and attempting to predict
                        every eventuality.
                        That habit of mind — careful contemplation and planning — is one of the cognitive health
                        benefits of playing chess.
                        Behavioral scientistsTrusted Source gave two groups of people the Tower of London test — a
                        cognitive functioning test involving pegs and beads — and measured their planning skills. The
                        group that regularly played chess demonstrated significantly better planning skills than the
                        group that did not play chess. Also, people in the chess group spent a lot more time making
                        decisions during the test.</p>
